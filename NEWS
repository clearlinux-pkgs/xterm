                            Patch #377 - 2022/11/25

     * add  control  sequences  for  reporting  the  current  state of the
       modified   keys   options   (XTQMODKEYS)   and   allowed/disallowed
       operations   (XTQALLOWED),   (prompted   by  discussion  with  Bram
       Moolenaar).
     * amend  modifyOtherKeys  case  2 to distinguish the escape character
       with  modifiers,  e.g., shift-escape, from a plain escape character
       (suggested by Bram Moolenaar).
     * improve  parsing and error-recovery in the case where a list of X11
       bitmap fonts is given in the -fn and related options.
     * change  default  for  xftTrackMemUsage to false, because libXft has
       does not handle certain fonts.
