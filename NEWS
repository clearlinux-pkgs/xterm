                            Patch #365 - 2021/02/03

     * amend fix for “word” selection in patch #364 to limit that to the
       insert-selectable  action,  which  reads data from the screen. This
       restores the interactive behavior where double-clicking on a “word”
       would  make  subsequent  selection  extensions  by words as well as
       suppressing   some  boundary-checks  (report  by  David  Wolfskill,
       FreeBSD #253225).
