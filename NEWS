     * adjust  reported  window-position by the shell window's border with
       in XTWINOPS 13, for better match with the position set via XTWINOPS
       3, fixing a mismatch seen with esctest.
     * improve ifdef'ing of infrequently-configured features.
     * add vttests/query-allowed.pl, to illustrate OSC 60, 61, and 62.
     * add OSC 62, to provide a list of features which can be specified to
       be disabled/enabled via resource settings or menus.
     * restore  a  check needed for Debian #1084794, which was lost in the
       changes for patch #400 (report by Sean C Farley).
     * correct  spelling  for  "allowWindowOps"  in  OSC  61. The original
       spelling "allowWinOps" is still accepted.
