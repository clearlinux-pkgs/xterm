                            Patch #384 - 2023/07/10

     * exclude  ASCII  space  from  showMissingGlyphs,  since a few bitmap
       fonts lack this (report by "SanRemo", Emanuel Haupt).
     * correct   a   step   in   rendering  double-width  characters  with
       bitmap-fonts (report by Peter Fabinski, Debian #1039986).
     * fixes for ReGIS-related problems (report by Ben Wong):
          + mimic  an  undocumented  hardware  VT340 feature which handles
            color initialization with incomplete parameters.
          + handle whitespace between operator/operands for color values.
          + reset ReGIS-context when resetting graphics in RIS.
