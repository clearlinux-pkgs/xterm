                            Patch #375 - 2022/10/23

     * improve  error-recovery  when  setting  a bitmap font for the VT100
       window,  e.g.,  in  case  OSC 50  failed, restoring the most recent
       valid  font  so  that  a  subsequent  OSC 50 reports this correctly
       (report by David Leadbeater).
     * exclude  MC_XDG_OPEN  from environment variables trimmed on startup
       (report by Gabor Hauzer).
     * check for null pointer in isSelect() (report by Column Paget).
