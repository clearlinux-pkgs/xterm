                            Patch #390 - 2024/02/19

     * improve  typography  of  control-sequences page (patches by Branden
       Robinson).
     * amend   UPSS  change  from  patch  #389,  fixing  a  regression  in
       VT100/VT220 character sets.
     * modify ANSI conformance per ECMA-43 and DEC 070:
          + set ANSI conformance level to 3 for DEC levels 2 and up.
          + disable locking shifts in level 1, e.g., VT100.
          + disable single-shifts from G2/G3 in level 1.
          + use UPSS for G2/G3 in levels 2 and up.
     * modify invisible-character attribute to permit DECRQCRA to report a
       consistent checksum (report/testcase by Thomas Wolff).
     * align  terminfo building blocks in terminfo to correspond to recent
       refactoring/trimming in ncurses.
     * set flag in regexec call for onNClicks to handle “^” anchor (patch
       by Matthew Martin).
     * add  line-drawing  data  for  the characters in DEC Technical which
       have no Unicode equivalents.
     * remove a special case in encode_scs which made xterm report Latin-1
       when  encoding  is  set  to  UTF-8,  where  ASCII  is  the selected
       character  set.  This  fixes a regression in vttest for the DECRSPS
       cursor test.
     * correct  values  for  Ps of DECAUPSS in ctlseqs.ms (report by James
       Holderness).
     * simplify/correct  expression  for  checking  Unicode non-characters
       (report by Thomas Wolff).
     * correct  loop  for  trimming environment variables (report/patch by
       Casper Dik).
     * fixes for manpage formatting (Debian #1041809).
     * update config.guess, config.sub
