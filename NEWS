                            Patch #383 - 2023/06/27

     * expand description of full- and soft-reset in the manual.
     * fixes for full- and soft-reset:
          + clear alternate screen on full reset.
          + disable  menu-entry  for  active icon; it merely shows whether
            the feature is enabled.
          + use  appcursorDefault and appkeypadDefault resources for reset
            of DECCKM and DECKPM.
          + save   initial   resource   values   for   sixelScrolling  and
            privateColorRegisters, using those in full reset.
          + update  checkbox  for Enable Blinking Cursor (report by Rajeev
            V. Pillai).
     * add reply for DECSACE with DECRQSS.
     * modify status-line feature to exit without erasing for DECSTR.
     * add private mode 1045 which imitates the original xterm cursor-back
       reverse wrapping mode 45 (see patch #380).
     * improve checks for non-Unicode values, e.g., in DECRQCRA.
     * re-checkout  from  RCS  archive to fix stale identifiers (report by
       Sven Joachim).
