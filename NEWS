                            Patch #398 - 2025/04/11

     * modify  DECFRA  and  DECRQCRA  to handle NRCS and ISO character set
       mappings.
     * ensure  that the cursor GC is updated when switching between normal
       and italic fonts (report/testcase by Peter Fabinski).
     * reduce overflow in scaling of ReGIS coordinates (report/testcase by
       Robert L Masterson).
     * improve permissions-check for valid shell program.
     * extend   modifyOtherKeys   and   formatOtherKeys   to  the  various
       categories  of  special  keys,  i.e.,  cursor-keys,  function-keys,
       keypad-keys, modifier-keys and (other) special-keys.
          + review/extend  convmap.pl  to  handle  all  of  the X11 keysym
            definitions in keysym2ucs.
          + keysyms which do not correspond to Unicode character codes are
            mapped to Unicode private use areas in the BMP and plane 15.
          + add/extend   control   sequences   for  the  new  format-  and
            modify-resources.
     * fix  copy/paste  error  in  configure  script  for default value of
       --enable-block-select (report by Vincent Lefèvre).
     * revise keysym2ucs.c, to provide mapping to/from the Unicode private
       use  area  for  non-character  keysyms. Also remove redundant items
       from keysym.map.
     * improve  modifyOtherKeys, by providing the UCS value for keys which
       have no single-byte representation (Debian #1093056).
     * add two extensions to modifyOtherKeys:
          + setting  modifyOtherKeys  to  3  makes all keyboard input send
            escape  sequences,  using  parameter  1 where no modifiers are
            given.
          + a subparameter can be added to the XTMODKEYS control sequence,
            telling  xterm  to  factor-out the corresponding modifier mask
            from available parameters in the modifyOtherKeys feature.
     * add  items  ColumnMode  and  StatusLine  to  disallowWindowOps, for
       DECCOLM,  DECANM  and DECSASD, DECSSDT respectively (report by Sami
       Farin).
     * fix several minor issues reported by Coverity.
     * add  ColorEvents resource to provide a way for applications to send
       a  client  message  which  can  modify  the  default foreground and
       background colors (adapted from patch by Claes Nästén).
     * add  special  case  for  displaying  an error for CAN (cancel) when
       emulating VT100 (prompted by discussion with Thomas Wolff).
     * correct  the  size  of  a CellData buffer in xtermReportSGR seen in
       ASAN2 (report by Sami Farin).
