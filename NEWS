                            Patch #393 - 2024/07/11

     * add a check for ANSI SC/RC, to ignore CSI parameters.
     * improve  check for missing characters for bitmap-fonts by using the
       normal font for reference in the case where the current font, e.g.,
       the   wide-font   was  derived  from  the  normal  font  and  lacks
       per-character metrics (report by Rajeev V. Pillai).
     * fix regression in error-recovery for SGR parameters from patch #357
       (report by James Holderness).
     * remove some duplicates in xtermcfg.h (report by Matthew Green).
     * change default for --enable-imake configure option.
     * fixes for wcwidth:
          + return  0  for  format  effectors,  like a zero-width printing
            character  rather  than -1 like a control character (report by
            Rajeev V. Pillai).
          + correct  doublewidth  to account for reserved codepoints which
            are listed in the EastAsianWidth file.
          + add a special case for surrogate pairs, which might be checked
            in testing the wcwidth function.
     * amend   sixel   bounds-check  added  in  patch  #371  to  not  wrap
       out-of-bounds data.
     * eliminate maxStringParse limit for SIXEL.
     * improve  logic  which  ignores APC, PM and SOS controls to also not
       accumulate their data temporarily in a buffer.
     * exclude  TERM_INGRESS  from cleanup of environment variables (patch
       by Iain Riley).
     * fix some documentation typos (report by Thomas Wolff).
