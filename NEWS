                            Patch #380 - 2023/05/09

     * simplify  the  change for sixelScrolling from patch #374 (report by
       Per Bothner).
     * add  xterm+focus  and  report+da2,  update  report+version building
       blocks in terminfo, from post-ncurses 6.4
     * drop  the  -title  option  from uxterm and koi8rxterm, because that
       interferes  with  deriving  the  default  title  from the -e option
       (Debian  #1031837).  Compensate for this by using the -class option
       to derive a default title.
     * improve  description of readline 2003 mode in ctlseqs.ms (report by
       Thomas Wolff).
     * other improvements to status-line feature (report by Thomas Wolff):
          + clear status line on DECCOLM
          + ignore DECSASD if no previous DECSSDT
          + allow  DECSSDT 1  immediately  after  DECSSDT 2, i.e., without
            switching back to host mode.
     * adjust  RequestResize  to avoid shrinking screen when using DECCOLM
       while the status-line is active (report/patch by Thomas Wolff).
     * disallow wrapping before the beginning of the screen, to the end of
       the screen, for cursor-back sequences (Redhat #2182357).
     * modify  makefile  to  install the 16x16 xpm files (report by Harald
       Dunkel).
     * update test-package to reflect resolution of Debian #906901.
     * change default of showMissingGlyphs to True.
     * improve handling of double-sized characters when those happen to be
       missing from the bitmap font and/or are fullwidth.
     * pointer/overflow fixes (reported by David Leadbeater):
          + improve  limit-checks  for control-sequence numeric parameters
            in SIXEL graphics.
          + add  null-pointer  checks  in  WriteNow macro to handle a case
            where  SS2  or  SS3  might  be  in  effect  while processing a
            combining character.
          + disallow  ReGIS  reporting  for character-set names containing
            characters other than alphanumerics or underscore.
          + implement  TrueType fallback font for double-sized characters,
            including  Unicode  fullwidth.  Also  add  limitFontHeight  to
            provide    for    configuring    the    distinction    between
            slightly-oversized glyphs and double-sized glyphs.
     * configure script improvements:
          + check for nfsd_t
     * fix  a  typo in the underline cursor thickness derivation (patch by
       Jan Engelhardt).
