     * improve rendering of TrueType fonts:
          + add  resource xftTrackMemUsage to enable/disable a new feature
            of Xft which improves performance.
          + add   resources   xftMaxGlyphMemory  and  xftMaxUnrefFonts  to
            customize memory-usage of Xft and fontconfig.
          + provide for display of colored fonts in libXft 2.3.5
          + allow for an extra TrueType font to be specified using the -fa
            option,  as  an  override to the fontconfig scheme of fallback
            fonts (request by Nickolas Raymond Kaczynski).
          + improve caching of TrueType missing-glyph tests.
          + allow no more than 255 fonts to be scanned for a fontset.
          + eliminate a table-lookup in findXftGlyph
     * improvements status-line feature:
          + save/restore  wraparound  flag  when  updating the status-line
            (report by Rajeev V. Pillai).
          + avoid  clearing  the status-line when switching between normal
            and alternate screens (report by Valtteri Vuorikoski).
          + remove  adjustment  from  update_winsize leftover from initial
            work (report by Valtteri Vuorikoski).
     * modify wcwidth tables to separate Unicode Cf category as formatting
       control-characters,  to  better match the guideline for unsupported

     * add configure option --disable-exec-selection.
     * use mkstemp where mkdtemp is unavailable, when initializing colored
       cursor.

          + improve ifdef's for a few optional features.
          + correct #ifdef to #if in a few uses of OPT_PRINT_ON_EXIT.
     * set   StartupWMClass   in   “.desktop”  files,  e.g.,  to  help
       cinnamon-session  notice  that xterm sets WM_CLASS and use its icon
       (patch by Richard de Boer).
     * disable pixel computation when rgb width is greater than 8, to work
       with depth 30 (patch by Denis Kaganovich).
     * improve  color-computation  for  SGR  2  faint/dim  (patch by Boian
       Bonev).  Add  resource  faintIsRelative  to specify if the modified

       Herrb).
     * correct  comparison-length  for environment variable cleanup (patch
       by Brendan O' Dea).

       with shellcheck.

     * amend  change for combining characters in patch #371 to limit it to
       the currently-defined codes (report by Thomas Wolff).

       improve portability to older systems (patch by Ryan Schmidt).
