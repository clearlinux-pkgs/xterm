                            Patch #367 - 2021/03/26

     * add  OSC 22 to allow programs to select different pointer cursor at
       runtime.
     * change  configuration for no-return functions to use _Noreturn when
       it  is  available, because clang --analyze does not properly handle
       the gcc noreturn attribute.
     * add  cursorTheme resource to provide a way to enable or disable the
       cursor theme feature.
     * modified  CopyWait  event retries to use shorter sleeps, to improve
       responsiveness (tmux #2556).
     * improve quoting/escaping in demo-scripts per shellcheck.
     * add  resizeByPixel  resource,  to  permit  disabling window manager
       resizing-hints (patch by Tim Oehl).
     * corrected  printOptsImmediate  handling of alternate-screen (report
       by Abhijit Dasgupta).
     * update sample terminfo to more closely match ncurses.
     * add/improve limit-checks for Xlib calls (report by Roman Fiedler).
     * fix a typo in the help-message (report by Tomas Korbar).
