                            Patch #371 - 2022/02/24

     * drop   double-buffer   default   from   test-packages,  since  that
       interferes with status-line.
     * add  faceSize7  to  table  in  charproc.c, overlooked in patch #360
       (patch by Vladimir A. Pavlov).
     * use  XDrawString rather than XDrawString16 for text when the latter
       is not needed.
     * improve performance for initializing/reusing graphic objects in the
       SIXEL feature.
     * improve error-checking for resize.
     * fix errata in manual page (Debian #988221).
     * extended  list  of environment variables to purge on startup, i.e.,
       in case a user starts xterm from another terminal emulator.
     * add  comment  in cursor.c to explain why autowrap (DECAWM) does not
       apply  to  data  saved/restored with save/restore cursor-operations
       (report by Thomas Wolff).
     * add  special  case  in  generating the combining-character table in
       wcwidth.c,  for  Hangul  Jamo  Extended-B  (report  by  Luis Javier
       Merino).
     * simplify/improve portability of trap commands in shell-scripts.
     * update configure options
       --disable-rectangles,
       --disable-tcap-fkeys and
       --disable-tcap-query
       to account for changed default settings.
     * rather  than  ignore empty parameter for setting title, use that to
       reset it to “xterm” for scripting.
     * check  for  out-of-bounds  condition while drawing sixels, and quit
       that operation (report by Nick Black).
     * add  fallback definition for PROJECTROOT so that a suitable default
       location for luit will be compiled-in on build-servers.
     * implement DEC status-line controls DECSASD/DECSSDT:
          + decode controls, set state
          + implement DECRQSS responses
          + implement indicator-style status-line
          + add configure option --enable-status-line
          + add resource indicatorFormat
          + implement    host-writable   status-line,   able   to   handle
            video-attributes  and  simple left/right cursor movement. This
            disallows all of the DEC/xterm private modes such as switching
            to/from the alternate screen.
          + move the status-line if the window is resized.
          + Note:  the  associated  screen-resizing  does not work for the
            special case of TrueType fonts with double-buffering (see note
            in patch #349).
     * modify  configure-script fixup for -Werror options to exclude fixup
       for -Werror=format, e.g., -Werror=format-security.
     * amend  change  from  patch  #370; DEC 070's pseudo-code for DECCOLM
       incorrectly suggests that it enables DECLRMM as a side-effect.
     * fix  some  memory leaks seen using esctest and asan2 (patch by Luis
       Javier Merino).
